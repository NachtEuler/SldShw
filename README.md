# SldShw

**NICHE:**
	
SldShw was created to be a simple presentation tool focused on a handling
large batches of images more conveniently that MS Power Point or Open
Office Presentation; it is the vein of Windows Photo Viewer but with
expanded capabilities.

<br>

**PURPOSE:**

It initially was designed and written for use in a church presentation in
June 2015.

<br>

**FEATURES:**

- Image Playback
- Audio Playback
- Multiple Monitors
- Multiple Transition Styles
- Custom Scripting of Presentations
- Pause and Sync accorss multiple mointors and audio.
- Remote Control via WiFi (client yet to be added)

<br>

**CURRENT NOTES:**

The Parsing code was hacked out in utilitarian fashion for the original
presentation, which needed the the input file to assign specific timing
to title slides. It has been moved to make room for commandline features,
with the ultimate goal of making the program even more ad-hoc. Eventually,
I intend for music & pictures be culled together from the current directory
and run in regular loop, similar to the function of Windows Photo Viewer.

The client was loaded on my phone via Android Studio's debugging feature.
I still need to decide in what capacity to add it this repository.
