	SldShw - version 1.0
	
	This version of SldShw is an original creation for use on a church slide
	show. The motivation for creating the program was to produce a simple but
	high quality presentation from folders of ordered files in the fashion of
	Windows Photo Viewer (avoiding slide-by-slide work in MS Power Point 97);
	but to go beyond Windows Photo Viewer in terms of functionality including:
		- better speed control (to synchronize with music duration)
		- mp3 playback (synchronized to start)
		- smoother transitions
		- custom background for images which don't fill the screen
		- non-looping behavior
		
	As I worked on the project I added things out of necessity or desire, which
	were not part of my original plans. The main tweaks had to be done to make
	the presentation run in a timely fashion:
		- switched from java.awt.Timer to separate threads with sleep:
			Apparently some of the image methods populate the Event queue and
			prevent Timer's events from being received promptly when issued.
		- prerender/buffer transitions to playback at adequate speed
		- added timing analysis to track lost time due by the program
		  (especially to rendering) and shorten delays as needed.
		- created a file-based input to describe presentations:
			A single presentation this could have been hard coded but do to
			the number of excess pictures it was decided a separate looped
			presentation would be played after the service.
		- added multiple scaling schemes and transitions to determine what
		  would look best:
			While scaling to fit is the obvious choice for picture, the option
			to not scale was a great convenience for transparent PNGs to
			produce higher quality text.
		[The following are mostly my desired extras]
		- Handled multiple monitors with GraphicsDevice:
			Otherwise, the external monitor/projector must be the default or
			you duplicate the display (icky for 9:16 laptop and 3:4 projector)
		- Added multiple >video capabilities to go with multiple monitors, and
		  the :link command for complex slidecore graphs
		- Added :window command and functionality for debugging on a single
		  monitor.
		- Added SldShwLAN.java and :remote command to start an already loaded
		  presentation remotely:
			The server uses multicast to advertise it's address and port,
			which are received by a small client for Android.
