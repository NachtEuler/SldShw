		--- Creating a Slide Show from a File ---

 A file for a slide show is a series of text describing the contents and order
 of the show. Plain text editors (e.g. notepad) should be use. WYSIWYG editors
 (e.g. MS Word) add formatting characters and headers which will not be parsed
 correctly by SldShw. The data is broken up by sections which follow a general
 theme of listing files or directories, relative to the location of the slide
 show file or by absolute path. The example shown below have comments to the
 right following "|" which cannot be included or imitated in practice. The
 example is meant to showcase most of the features, much simpler presentations
 can be assembled as well.
 
 --- EXAMPLE SLIDESHOW FILE ---
> Audio				| begins the audio sequence (there can only be one)
intro_song.mp3			| plays intro_song.mp3
: loop				| start of a loop
music_folder			| plays all files in music_folder
: end				| end sequence, the returns to start of the loop
				|
> Video				| begins a video sequence
: background back.jpg		| loads back.jpg as background (before monitors)
: monitor 1			| the sequence will play on the 1st monitor/screen
intro_1.jpg			| shows intro_1.jpg, scaled to fit and cross fade
intro_2.png 0 - 2 -		| shows intro_1.jpg, no scaling and through fade
picture_folder			| shows all files in picture_folder, fit and cross fade
: end				| end this sequence, fade to black
				|
> Video				| begins another video sequence
: background back2.jpg		| loads another background
: trans 2			| starts with a trough fade transitions
picture_folder2	2 - - -		| shows all files in another folder, scaled to fill
: trans 2			| through fades at the end of the folder
: loop				| start of a loop
finale.jpg - - 0 -		| shows finale.jpg, with cut transition (to finale.jpg)
: end				| end this sequence, show finale indefinitely
				| sequence will be shown on the last available monitor


 --- ANATOMY OF A SLIDE ---
 
 Each slide consist of an image to be displayed and set of parameter saying
 how it is displayed and for how long, and what transition follows it and for
 how long. A timeline over the slide in play looks something like this:
  
   ... prior trans |         image          | transition |  next slide ...
   ----------------+------------------------+------------+----------------
                   | one slide's data cover this section |                

 The four parameters governing each slide can be specified for each slide in
 a sequence using the commands described in the following section. These
 parameters are as follows:
 	scale		- how the image will be scaled on the screen
 	length		- the duration of the image in seconds
 	trans		- the effect used in the transition
 	span		- the duration of the the transition in seconds
 All parameters use numerical values. The length and span can be decimals, but
 the scale and trans are numerical codes corresponding to special styles.
 These styles are listed below:
 
 SCALING CODES AND STYLES
	0	NONE - the image is displayed in it's own resolutions, which is
		best for images with transparency.
	1	FIT - the image scales to the screens interior, but preserving it's
		own aspect ratio.
	2	FILL - the image scales fill the screen, preserving it's own aspect
		ratio, but some of the image will be clipped by the screen bounds.
		
 TRANSITION CODES AND STYLES
	0	CUT - the image switches abruptly to the next one.
	1	CROSS FADE - the image slowly fades directly into the next one.
		Sometimes called DISOLVE.
	2	V FADE - the image fades out, showing the background, then the next
		image fades in. Sometimes called THROUGH FADE.
	3	X FADE - the image fades out while the next images fades in.
		Very similar to the cross fade, but the background is visible through
		the two fading images.
	



 --- COMMANDS ---
 
 All commands begin in one of three ways. Prefix exist specifically
 to separate special commands from file names.
 	>	Start a new audio or video sequence (there can be only one audio)
 	:	Modify the audio or video sequence
 		No prefix, line begins with file or directory to load from
 Below are all the special commands formats. Lines will contain items in
 brackets (e.g. [file]) which denote a variable to be replaced with the
 specified data (e.g. [file] might be "Photos\pic2.jpg").
 
 
 
 --- VIDEO COMMANDS ---
 
 : background [file]
 	Loads [file] as the background on all future monitors.
 	
 : monitor [id]
 	Specifies that monitor number [id] will show this sequence. A monitors
 	if should correspond to the OS display numbers, which in Windows 7 can
 	be found with the Screen Resolution or Display Settings.
 	
 : window [id] [width] [height] [xPos] [yPos]
	Creates a window on monitor [id] to show this sequence. The [width] and
	[height] are decimal ratios of the screen. The [xPos] and [yPos] are
	decimal ratios of the screen, at which the center of the window is to
	be shown.
 	
 : loop
 	Specifies that the show should loop back to here upon ending.
 	NOTE: Some commands may not work as expected following loop. As said
 	commands modify the last loaded slide, which was created before loop.
 	
 : [parameter] [value]
 	Specifies the last loaded slide's [parameter] be [value]. Parameter
 	information can be found in the Slide Anatomy Section.
	
 [file]
	Loads [file] as a slide using the default parameters.
	
 [file] [scale] [length] [trans] [span]
	Loads [file] as a slide using the specified parameters.
	NOTE: If any of the values should be default, replace the corresponding
	entry with a hyphen/minus (e.g. pic 1 - - - only changes the scale).
	
 [folder]
	Loads all files in [folder] as slides using the default parameters.
	
 [file/folder] [scale] [length] [trans] [span]
	Loads all files in [folder] as slides using the specified parameters.
	NOTE: If any of the values should be default, replace the corresponding
	entry with a hyphen/minus (e.g. pic 1 - - - only changes the scale).
 	
 : end
 	The end of a sequence. If a loop has been specified, the video will loop
 	back to that point. Otherwise the video will go black after the final
 	slide.
 	


 --- AUDIO COMMANDS ---
 
 : loop
 	Specifies that the audio should loop back to here upon ending.
 	
 [file]
 	Loads [file] as a song.
 	
 [folder]
 	Loads all files in [folder] as songs. Does not include subfolders.
 	
 : end
 	The end of the audio sequence. If a loop has been specified, audio will
 	loop back to that point. Otherwise audio stops.
 	
 	
 --- DEFAULT COMMANDS ---
 There can also be one Default sequence at the top of the file to modify the
 default settings for a slide show. The supported options are:
 
 : [parameter] [value]
 	Specifies the default value of [parameter] in new sequences be [value].
 	Parameter information can be found in the Slide Anatomy Section.
 	
 : FPS [value]
 	Specifies that [value] frames per second used for calculations made to
 	render and time transitions.
 	NOTE: The default value is 25 for good reasons, it is slightly above
 	video standards of 24 FPS, and perfect divisor of 1000ms removing the
 	the possibility of accumulating rounding errors.
 	
 : latency [value]
 	Specifies the program monitor audio play back every [value] ms. If a track
 	ends it can take 0 to [value] ms to note that it has ended and begin the
 	track.
 	NOTE: The default value is 10ms. Setting the value to low numbers
 	(especially 0) may consume CPU time and negatively affect this or other
 	programs.
 	
 : fast
 	Specifies that images are scaled using a fast strategy which may offer
 	increased performance for slower machines, but lower quality.
 	
 : smooth
 	Specifies that images are scaled using a smooth strategy which may offer
 	higher quality but hurt performance on slower machines. This strategy is
 	used by default.
 	
 : remote
 	Enables a server-module to advertise this program on a LAN device, and
 	receive start and quit instructions from a client.
 	NOTE: This feature uses multicasting and is designed only for devices
 	sharing a common router. It simply may not work on some networks.
